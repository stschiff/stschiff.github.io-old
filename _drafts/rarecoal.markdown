This is where _rarecoal_ comes in. Rarecoal fits a demographic model to the rare site frequecy spectrum.

This is in principle not something terribly new, there are already methods to infer demographic models from the joint site frequency spectrum (e.g. DaDi, Momi, Fastsimcoal). However, rarecoal is arguably the first that is scalable to arbitrary sample sizes, by using a trick that makes inference independent of the total sample size. Here is how it works:
